# For Loop DevOps use-cases

1. **Server Provisioning and Configuration:**

   DevOps engineers use "for" loops when provisioning multiple servers or virtual machines with the same configuration. For example, when setting up monitoring agents on multiple servers:

   ```servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

def configure_monitoring_agent(server):
    # Function to configure monitoring agent for the server
    print(f"Configuring monitoring agent for {server}")

for server in servers:
    configure_monitoring_agent(server)
   ```

2. **Deploying Configurations to Multiple Environments:**

   When deploying configurations to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), DevOps engineers can use a "for" loop to apply the same configuration changes to each environment:

   ```# Define the function to simulate deploying a configuration
def deploy_configuration(env):
    print(f"Deploying configuration to {env} environment")

# List of environments
environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]

# Loop through each environment and deploy configuration
for env in environments:
    deploy_configuration(env)
   ```

3. **Backup and Restore Operations:**

   Automating backup and restore operations is a common use case. DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to create backups for multiple databases or services and later restore them as needed.

   ```# Define the function first
def database_backup(db):
    print(f"backup for {db} database")

# List of databases
database = ["mongo", "pg", "mssql"]

# Loop through each database and call the backup function
for db in database:
    database_backup(db)
   ```

4. **Log Rotation and Cleanup:**

   DevOps engineers use "for" loops to manage log files, rotate logs, and clean up older log files to save disk space.

   ```# List of log files
log_files = ["app.log", "access.log", "error.log"]

# Define the function to rotate and clean up logs
def rotate_and_cleanup_logs(log_file):
    print(f"Rotating and cleaning up {log_file}")

# Loop through each log file and call the rotate_and_cleanup_logs function
for log_file in log_files:
    rotate_and_cleanup_logs(log_file)
   ```

5. **Monitoring and Reporting:**

   In scenarios where you need to gather data or perform checks on multiple systems, a "for" loop is handy. For example, monitoring server resources across multiple machines:

   ```# List of servers
servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

# Define the function to check resource utilization
def check_resource_utilization(server):
    print(f"Checking resource utilization for {server}")

# Loop through each server and call the check_resource_utilization function
for server in servers:
    check_resource_utilization(server)
   ```

6. **Managing Cloud Resources:**

   When working with cloud infrastructure, DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to manage resources like virtual machines, databases, and storage across different cloud providers.

   ```# List of instances
instances = ["instance1", "instance2", "instance3"]

# Define the function to resize an instance
def resize_instance(instance):
    print(f"Resizing {instance}")

# Loop through each instance and call the resize_instance function
for instance in instances:
    resize_instance(instance)
   ```
